# Description

This app uses express within nodeJS to set up a locally-hosted server with multiple endpoints that deploys to a live web app using Heroku.
The user-interface ultimately presents as a note-taking web application whereby users can view recently saved notes and enter new ones.

For the first time, student is tasked with coordinating a smooth function between front-end and back-end developing. Using starter code that essentially makes up the front-end implementation of the note-taking app, student's goal is to create a server, routing points, and json reading and writing functionality to bring to life the data-saving, data-reading, and data-sending activities that make up the back-end code. Once created, and implemented, the app's back-end code is able to receive communication from front-end UI activity and react as is needed.

See below for user story for context:
